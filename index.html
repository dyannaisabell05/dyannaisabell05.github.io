        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Administration</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Isabell Gracia, I am currently a University Student at University of California, Riverside looking to gain work experience within my field of study, Business Administration with a concentration in Management. I plan to take into consideration any kind of experience that I feel would benefit my knowledge in Business Management from intern positions to seasonal positions.<br><br>

        A quote I find myself looking towards is "When passion meets work, work becomes a hobby" - Aniekee Tochukwu Ezekiel. It is everyones dream to be able to work while doing the things they love. When I'm not studying I find myself doing very hands on activities such as baking, "do-it-yourself" projects, and drawing. All of which can now be incorparated into jobs or small businesses. I would very much like my future career to have this hands on aspect where I can actually make impactful decisions and influence a change in a company or small business. Growing up in my hometown La Puente, I had the opportunity to see a variety of small business come together. However, I also saw many of these businesses fail to succeed in the changing economy and being forced to close their doors. As someone with an ambitious and creative mindset the idea of entrepreneurship always grasped my attention. This would then influence my choice of major when applying to university. While I am still considered a pre-business student I plan to concentrate in Management with a pathway in entrepreneurship. By focusing my study in management and entrepreneurship I will be preparing myself for the potential start of my own business. I plan to incorporate as much creativity and personality into my business to make it distinct and unique from others within the same industry. As the number of businesses continues to grow I want to set my own apart as much as I can to ensure that I succeed.  <br><br>

        While I may not have any official work experience, I have still managed to build my own portfolio from leadership experience, volunteer experience, and my own form of a small business. While in high school, I focused primarily on my studies and maintaining good grades. I made sure to still participate in extracurriculars that would enhance my skills. These included particpating and becoming a part of the Associated Student Body which helped enhance my communication skills and how I work with others on collaborative projects. Furthermore, I volunteered at local community and senior centers to improve my coordination skills and problem solving skills when issues arose. Lastly, at the start of the 2020 pandemic I took interest in the art of baking which led to the start of my personal business in 2021. I took initiative and risks in order to learn the basics of how a business functions. Although it was a business started from home, it is an experience that I value very much as it is only the beginning to my ventures in the future. I appreciate the time taken to get to know me, my passions, and my professional goals better. I hope to be in contact soon!
